# About Me
## My Interests
I enjoy **cooking**. My favorite dishes to cook are pasta dishes. I *prefer cooking with white sauces* rather than red sauces and I love making pasta from scratch.

I'm interested in **Political Science** and **_current events_**. I spend a lot of time reading the news and keeping up with elections and public policy. I'm planning to participate in the National Political Science Bee, and I'll be taking the qualifying exam on October 4th.

I also participate in many student societites and organizations at my school, including *Student Government*, *honor societies*, and *civic action clubs*. I hold leadership in all three of these and plan various events and activities for students and the community.
